 //an array cannot be returned in cpp
//hence a way through to return an array in cpp
//POINTERSSSSSSSSSSSS-holds the memory address,pointing at the memory address
//*-data type ,&-value
/*A pointer stores a memory address â€” but the address alone doesn't tell the compiler:

How many bytes to read or write

What kind of data (int, float, char, etc.) is at that location

So when you write:


int* ptr;
You're telling the compiler:

ptr is a pointer to an int

At the address stored in ptr, you will find an int-sized value

When you do *ptr, treat that memory as an int
