## ✅ What’s Inside / Why This Repo

- Practice files to understand fundamental OOP concepts (classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, etc.) in C++.  
- Implementation of basic and intermediate data-structures / algorithms (arrays, trees, etc.), helping you build a strong foundation.  
- A variety of coding problems (in the `questions/` folder) — useful for honing problem-solving skills and preparing for interviews or competitive programming.  
- A structured approach: by categorizing code by topic, it’s easier to navigate through learning material and track progress over time.

## 🚀 How to Use / Get Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pushparajwastaken/cpp_practice.git
````

2. Navigate to the folder relevant to what you want to explore. For example:

   ```bash
   cd cpp_practice/OOP
   ```
3. Compile & run a C++ file using your favourite compiler. Example (with `g++`):

   ```bash
   g++ MyProgram.cpp -o MyProgram
   ./MyProgram
   ```
4. You can also compile multiple files if needed (for projects needing more than one source/header file).

## 📚 What You’ll Learn / Use Cases

* Understand and practice core OOP paradigms in C++.
* Get comfortable with writing and running C++ code from scratch (no external dependencies or frameworks).
* Use as a reference collection for data-structures, common problems, and typical coding patterns.
* Ideal for self-learning, interview preparation, or refreshing fundamentals before advanced projects.

---

## ✨ Future / To-Do (Possible Enhancements)

* Add more data-structures (linked lists, graphs, heaps, etc.).
* Include algorithms on top of data-structures (sorting, searching, tree / graph traversal, dynamic programming, etc.).
* Add sample input/output or test cases for each file for easier testing and verification.
* Add comments and documentation for more complex programs to improve readability and maintainability.
* Add a “contributing guideline” if others want to contribute — to keep repository organized and consistent.
